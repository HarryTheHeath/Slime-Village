# Idea #1: Stardew Valley-Esque NPC time-driven pathfinding (Unity Project)
### Goals:
- Have several NPCs follow unique schedules to leave at certain times of day and return by another.
- Houses and points of interest will be plotted on a square grid.
- They will need to be able to manoeuvre around other NPCs.
- Places to go when leaving the house will be randomized, but with each point being a unique location for each NPC (i.e. no overlaps).
- A day/ night system needs to be implemented to keep track of times and the cycle.
- AI will use pathfinding to pre-determine their path but use random offsets or similar to manoeuvre past other AIs

### Bonus:
- May update block paths or have a Playable character to mess with their schedules.
- AI needs to recalculate their paths.
- Player can interact with NPCs. Time is paused if they do.
- Player has fatigue and must make it back home by a certain time.
- Player uses their own click-driven pathfinding instead of updated input commands.

# Idea #2: Slenderman-Like Stalker Enemy (Unity Project)
### Goals:
- Have a main character and an enemy that stalks them around a square grid.
- If the stalking enemy reaches the Player the game ends.
- Player must use the environment to their advantage as Stalker will be affected by tough terrain and blocked by walls.
- Player has fatigue and must use food to keep up their stamina, or else the Stalker will catch up to them.
- Time between food drops will increase over time, adding to the difficulty.

### Bonus:
- Make food have a 2nd use as a throwable that can halt the enemy.
- Have breakable objects. Player can build/ drop walls to halt the Stalker enemy.
- Player has a 2nd objective beyond surviving: a collect quest. Objects are randomly spawned each playthrough.
- Player's line of sight is radically reduced e.g. flashlight at night.
- Player can lose enemy if far enough away. But must complete collectables minigame to win. 
- Stalker will patrol randomly between waypoints if they've lost the Player.
- Player can cross water, though it's stamina heavy. Stalker must go around if following from behind.
